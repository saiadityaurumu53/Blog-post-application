CHAPTER 1 Building Django RESTful API application + Building the React app to consume the API 

Steps:
1. In the first step, we have started the project and named it as core => django-admin startproject core .
2. In the second step we have started 2 apps in the django application => python manage.py startapp blog
     python manage.py startapp blog_api
     Note: Here we are gonna create a Blog application which is having model for the blog and we need to serve this individually on a web server.
        our blog_api is going to manage the api for the blog.
3. Now, we need to create the urls.py in both the applications of the 'blog' and 'blog_api'
    blog => have the model for the blog
    blog_api => manage the API for the blog 
4. Include both the apps in the Installed apps in the settings.py file of the 'core' 
5. Now, we will define the paths and the namespaces in both the apps and the main core project urls.py
    a. use the fromat path('', include('blog.urls', namespace='blog'))
    Here, the blog.urls is the appname_dir, urls.py python file name. The namespace can be given as the app name
6. Now, we will define the urls.py file in both the apps 
7. Define the template directory in the core => setting.py 
    We can specify it as BASE_DIR / 'templates' => where templates is the separate folder which we have created


Creating the Models of the Blog app:
1. Here, our model is going to be a table in the database which is going to store all the post data 
2. So, our API is going to store the POST data of the react application 








How to run:
